# Project-Specific Instructions for Claude

## Documentation Policy

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT create report files or documentation files in markdown format unless explicitly requested by the user.**

This includes but is not limited to:
- Summary reports (SUMMARY.md, IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md, etc.)
- Migration guides (MIGRATION.md, etc.)
- Proposal documents (PROPOSAL.md, etc.)
- Phase reports (PHASE_*.md, etc.)
- Guide documents (GUIDE.md, COLOR_GUIDE.md, etc.)
- Any other .md files except README.md when necessary

## What TO Do Instead

- Focus on implementing code changes
- Provide brief summaries in chat responses
- Update existing README.md only when explicitly requested
- Answer user questions directly in conversation

## Exceptions

You may create markdown files ONLY when:
- The user explicitly asks for a specific markdown file by name
- The user requests written documentation
- It's a critical project file like README.md and the user approves
